Here is a Dockerfile that can build a small docker image with Openjdk8 and Apache Ace in it for the Inaetics project. The purpose of this Dockerfile is to build fast the image and to have a "builder image" as small as possible.
If you want more details you can see the comment in the Dockerfile or for even more details you can see this github : https://github.com/florian-gauvin/Dockerfile-that-build-a-small-Docker-Image-with-Openjdk8-and-Apache-Ace-in-it . In this github there is a dockerfile with all the steps and all the details about my work.

To use this Dockerfile : 
Be sure to either uncomment the "ADD bundles /bundles" line in the Dockerfile, or map the "bundles" folder as a docker volume to /bundles when starting the container! 
First, build the dockerfile by running the following command : docker build -t "name-of-the-ace-image-builder" .
This will create a builder image of Apache Ace.
Then Run the following command :
docker run -ti --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock name-of-the-celix-image-builder
This will launch the builder image of Apache Ace and create automatically the small image with Openjdk8 and
Apache Ace in it.
Finally you will have a docker image named inaetics/ace-agent on your host, you can check by running the following command :
"docker images"

BE CAREFUL :
-You need to have the same docker version than there is in the image, in the image I'm
using the latest version of docker by running the following command : wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
